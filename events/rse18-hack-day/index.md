title: Citation File Format Hack Day @ RSE18
---

The [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) is a human-centric, machine-readable format for software citation metadata. It is developed to provide an easy way for RSEs, and other developers of software in academia, to ensure that they can receive credit for their work; Likewise, it provides researchers with access to the necessary metadata for references to the software they use in their research. The Citation File Format follows the [Software Citation Principles](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/), and is compatible with the [CodeMeta](http://codemeta.github.io/) JSON-LD exchange format for software metadata. It is being developed in the context of the [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group) and a wider community of stakeholders, including the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Recently, CFF has been adopted by [CiteAs.org](http://citeas.org/) as a source format, and its tools infrastructure is growing.

During a dedicated **Hack Day on Wednesday, 5 September** - co-locating with the [3rd Conference of Research Software Engineers (RSE18)](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) in Birmingham - we want to *a)* give an overview of - and discuss - the Citation File Format, its tooling and workflows; *b)* discuss what tools would be necessary to facilitate, e.g., better usability, optimized workflows, or integration with other tools in the software citation workflow (reference managers, repositories, other formats, etc.); *c)* do some actual work around existing and new tools, as well as the Citation File Format itself and its documentation.

**Participation is free and open to everyone**, regardless of their skill set and experience.

More info soon.
