title: Citation File Format Hack Day @ RSE18
toc: true
---

{% include toc %}

The [Citation File Format (CFF)](https://citation-file-format.github.io/) is a human-centric, machine-readable format for software citation metadata. It is developed to provide an easy way for RSEs, and other developers of software in academia, to ensure that they can receive credit for their work; Likewise, it provides researchers with access to the necessary metadata for references to the software they use in their research. The Citation File Format follows the [Software Citation Principles](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-86/), and is compatible with the [CodeMeta](http://codemeta.github.io/) JSON-LD exchange format for software metadata. It is being developed in the context of the [FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group](https://www.force11.org/group/software-citation-implementation-working-group) and a wider community of stakeholders, including the [Netherlands eScience Center](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/). Recently, CFF has been adopted by [CiteAs.org](http://citeas.org/) as a source format, and its tools infrastructure is growing.

## Hack Day at the 3rd Conference of Research Software Engineers

During a dedicated **Hack Day on Wednesday, 5 September** - co-locating with the [3rd Conference of Research Software Engineers (RSE18)](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) in Birmingham - we want to 

- *a)* give an overview of - and discuss - the Citation File Format, its tooling and workflows; 
- *b)* discuss what tools would be necessary to facilitate, e.g., better usability, optimized workflows, or integration with other tools in the software citation workflow (reference managers, repositories, other formats, etc.); 
- *c)* do some actual work around existing and new tools, as well as the Citation File Format itself and its documentation.

**The hack day is now fully booked!** If you have re-confirmed your participation
via email to Stephan Druskat, you will have received a confirmation email and preliminary infos
about the hack day, and have a place.  
Please confirm your wish to participate via email to *stephan* [dot] *druskat* 
[at] *hu-berlin* [dot] *de* to be added to the waiting list. If space becomes available for you,
you will be notified via email.

## Hack ideas

If you have an idea how the Citation File Format, its tooling, its
documentation, or its integration in the software citation workflow could be 
improved, you **please register your hack idea** in the 
Hack Ideas Spreadsheet at <http://bit.ly/cff-hack-ideas>.  
If you register a hack idea, please be prepared to present a very short
pitch of the idea during the hack day.
