The Citation File Format specifies how users can provide citation metadata for software or datasets that is easy to read by humans as well as by machines.

## Structure

`CITATION.cff` files in the Citation File Format consist of three parts:

1. The **software** (or dataset) **citation metadata** - as the most important part, this is **required**.
2. A **references** section - works like a references section in a paper, so that you can give credit to the authors of works that your software or dataset builds on.
3. One **preferred citation** - so that even when you ask people to cite your software or dataset, they can also additionally cite a traditional paper.

### Example

This is what a common `CITATION.cff` file for research software may look like:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: If you use this software, please cite it using these metadata.
title: My Research Software
abstract: This is my awesome research software. It does many things.
authors:
  - family-names: Druskat
    given-names: Stephan
    orcid: "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248"

identifiers:
  - description: This is the collection of archived snapshots of all versions of My Research Software
    type: doi
    value: "10.5281/zenodo.123456"
  - description: This is the archived snapshot of version 0.11.2 of My Research Software
    type: doi
    value: "10.5281/zenodo.123457"

repository-code: "https://github.com/citation-file-format/my-research-software"
```

## Format specifications :books:

You can find the complete format specifications in the [Guide to the Citation File Format schema](schema-guide.md).

## Why should I add a `CITATION.cff` file to my repository? :bulb:

When you do this, great things may happen:

1. People that find your software can easily cite it using the correct metadata from `CITATION.cff`!
2. If your repository is hosted on GitHub, [they will link to it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-citation-files) in a special "Cite this repository" widget on the repository landing page. Also, the citation information in `CITATION.cff` will be used when you publish your software on Zenodo via the [GitHub-Zenodo bridge](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/).
3. The citation information in `CITATION.cff` can be used by the open source reference manager [Zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero), when people import the repository.
