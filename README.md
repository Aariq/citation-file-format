The Citation File Format lets you provide citation metadata for software or datasets 
in plaintext files that are easy to read by both humans and machines.

## Structure

You can specify citation metadata for your software (or dataset) in a file named `CITATION.cff`.

This is what a typical `CITATION.cff` file for research software may look like:

```yaml
cff-version: 1.2.0
message: If you use this software, please cite it using these metadata.
title: My Research Software
abstract: This is my awesome research software. It does many things.
authors:
  - family-names: Druskat
    given-names: Stephan
    orcid: "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4925-7248"
version: 0.11.2
date-released: "2021-07-18"
identifiers:
  - description: This is the collection of archived snapshots of all versions of My Research Software
    type: doi
    value: "10.5281/zenodo.123456"
  - description: This is the archived snapshot of version 0.11.2 of My Research Software
    type: doi
    value: "10.5281/zenodo.123457"
license: Apache-2.0
repository-code: "https://github.com/citation-file-format/my-research-software"
```

In addition, the Citation File Format allows you to

- provide references to works that your software or dataset builds on ([see here for more info](schema-guide.md#referencing-other-work));
- ask people to cite a different, related work instead of the software or dataset itself ([see here for more info](schema-guide.md#credit-redirection)).

## Format specifications :books:

You can find the complete format specifications in the [Guide to the Citation File Format schema](schema-guide.md).

## Why should I add a `CITATION.cff` file to my repository? :bulb:

When you do this, great things may happen:

1. People that find your software can easily cite it using the correct metadata from `CITATION.cff`!
2. If your repository is hosted on GitHub, they will [show the citation information in the sidebar](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/about-citation-files), which makes it easy for visitors to cite your software or dataset correctly.
3. When you publish your software on Zenodo via the [GitHub-Zenodo integration](https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/), they will use the metadata from your `CITATION.cff` file.
4. People can import the correct reference to your software into the [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) reference manager via a [browser plugin](https://www.zotero.org/download/).
